## Story

Guinxu has hacked the game you lived in to make your arms too long and now FBI drones are coming for you, as people would realize they live in a simulation if they see your arms.

Move your arms with *A* and *D* or the arrow keys. Guiding yourself by the 3D sound of the drones flying. When you're hitting a drone it will vibrate, in this moment shoot it with your mouse.

If you're too slow the drones will kill you.
